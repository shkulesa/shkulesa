<h1 align="center">Hello! Welcome to my portfolio</h1>

<!---Hello! Welcome to my 
I am Sam Kulesa, a student at the University of St Thomas. I will graduate in the Spring of 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
Entering college, I planned on majoring in some type of Engineering. However, after taking <span style="font-weight: bold">CISC 131: Intro to Programming and Problem Solving</span>, I discovered my passion for coding and computer science. It was then then I decided to switch my major to Computer Science. MY journey as a computer science major has brough me closer to two of St. Thomas' values: excellence and service. During my time as a computer science major, I have been on a constant learning journey. My professors and classes have challeneged me to strive for academic excellence. The other value, service, cannot be achieved without some level of excellence. Without my courses and professors pushing me to be my best, I would be of no service to anyone else. I would be incapable of advancing the common good. This e-portfolio shows my progress towards becoming a student and person who displays excellence and is capable of service. It includes three projects from my time at St. Thomas. 
 

<h1><a href="https://github.com/shkulesa/Craps" target="_blank">Craps Game</a></h1>
The first project is a simulator of the game Craps. It taught me many important principles of programming and is a incdication of my progress in my first year.

<h1><a href="https://github.com/shkulesa/EnergyConsumption" target="_blank">Annual Energy Consumption server</a></h1>
The second project is a project that I worked on with two teammates for my web development class. It is a web server that displays information about Annual energy usage in the United States. It displays information from a database containing data pertaining to Annual Energy usage in the United States. This project relates to sustainability, as it documents energy usage.

<h1><a href="https://github.com/shkulesa/EnergyConsumption" target="_blank">St. Paul Crime App</a></h1>
The thrid project is the largest. I worked on this project with two other teammates. It is a combination of a RESTful API and a single page application. The RESTful API was written using node.js. The single page application was written using the Vue.js framework. The RESTful API queries a database containing logs of crimes committed in Saint Paul over the fast few years. This project used a number of frameworks and tools including: node.js, Foundation (css), Leaflet, Nominatim, and Vue.js.

In my time as a student at the University of St. Thomas, I worked on several projects, both personal and academic. These are 3 of the projects that I am most proud of. These 3 projects demonstrate my experience and knowledge of web/software development and object-oriented programming. The first project (Bug Tracker/Project Management App) is a personal project. The second and third projects (my personal website & St. Paul Crime Data Tracker) are from courses I took at St. Thomas.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/shkulesa/Bug-Tracker">Bug Tracker / Project Management App</a></h2>
This is a fullstack web app that I created as a way to learn new skills and technologies. It is written in the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. The app doubles as a project management app, and features users, projects, tickets, notes, roles, role-based permissions, authentication, a user dashboard which displays a user's projects and tickets, light/dark mode and more. The project is hosted on render.com and can be demoed <a href="https://bug-tracker-frontend.onrender.com" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. (NOTE: Render.com takes a minute to load when first accessing the site)

<h2><a href="https://github.com/shkulesa/shkulesa.github.io">My Personal Website</a></h2>
This personal website was an assignment for my web development course, where I learned to make static sites. The website is a simple static site built with the <a href="https://get.foundation/" target="_blank">Foundation CSS framework</a>. The website is responsive and displays my interests and projects. The website is deployed on Github Pages. Check it out <a href="https://shkulesa.github.io" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about me.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/shkulesa/StPaulCrime">Saint Paul Crime Data</a></h2>
This project was another assignment from one of my courses at St. Thomas. The Saint Paul Crime Data app displays all reported crime incidents from the past couple years in St. Paul. Markers show the location of the crimes, and users can create and delete new crime incidents from the database. Incidents can be filtered by neighborhood, type, day and time. The demo can be found on youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V92aN5nZBtw)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V92aN5nZBtw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V92aN5nZBtw)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V92aN5nZBtw</a>
