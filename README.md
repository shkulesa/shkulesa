Hello,
I am Sam Kulesa, a student at the University of St Thomas. I will graduate in the Spring of 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
Entering college, I planned on majoring in some type of Engineering. However, after taking <span style="font-weight: bold">CISC 131: Intro to Programming and Problem Solving</span>, I discovered my passion for coding and computer science. It was then then I decided to switch my major to Computer Science. MY journey as a computer science major has brough me closer to two of St. Thomas' values: excellence and service. During my time as a computer science major, I have been on a constant learning journey. My professors and classes have challeneged me to strive for academic excellence. The other value, service, cannot be achieved without some level of excellence. Without my courses and professors pushing me to be my best, I would be of no service to anyone else. I would be incapable of advancing the common good. This e-portfolio shows my progress towards becoming a student and person who displays excellence and is capable of service. It includes three projects from my time at St. Thomas. The first project
